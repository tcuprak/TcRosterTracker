/**Doc tip: Or take the easy (and better) road and never store state in a service
 ==== scope choices: =====
 prototype - A new service is created every time it is injected into another class
 request - A new service will be created per request
 flash - A new service will be created for the current and next request only
 flow - In web flows the service will exist for the scope of the flow
 conversation - In web flows the service will exist for the scope of the conversation. ie a root flow and its sub flows
 session - A service is created for the scope of a user session
 singleton (default) - Only one instance of the service ever exists
